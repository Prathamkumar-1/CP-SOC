# CP-SOC
<p>
<b><u>WEEK1</u></b><br>
We learnt the basics of CP in week1 that comprises sorting algorithms,time complexity anaylsis, about the different data structres like map,set,queue,stack etc.
Then it is about setting up one's respective template for coding efficiecny in contests and some problems were given as per the related topics to stregthen up the basics.

<b><u>WEEK2</u></b>
<p>
This week is more focused upon the recursive,backtracking and other efficient and popular algorithms commonly used in CP , for instance , kadane,binary search approach,two pointers approach etc.

<b><u>WEEK3</u></b>
<p>
This week is based upon DP and greedy algorithms , to learn and practise the problems associated with them.DP helps us to fasten the recursion type problems by either using memoization or dp table.DP just works like caching as it stores the data which has been calculated till the ongoing computation and use that data directly which eliminates the need to compute from very beginning , thus saving a lot of time . The greedy algorithm is based on greediness of some algorithms designed to solve a problem in such a way that  it chooses the best choice at every moment .This behaviour generally makes them quite efficient but on many occassions, they led to wrong solutions.

<b><u>WEEK 4 AND 5</u></b>
<p>
These two weeks take a deep dive into advanced data structures and problem-solving techniques. The focus was mainly on topics like segment trees, range queries, lazy propagation, binary indexed trees (Fenwick Trees), and other core concepts .The resource enriched my understanding of more complex data structures and their real-world applications, especially in contest environments.

<b><u>WEEK 6</u></b>
<p>
This week continues our advanced journey by covering graph theory and strings in greater detail. The chapters from the Competitive Programmer’s Handbook covers shortest paths (like Dijkstra’s and Bellman-Ford), breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), topological sorting, strongly connected components etc.

So , Overall the Project was quite interesting and it really helped me to boost my CP skills to a good extent. The Scheduling of Concepts and chapters were quite spot on and the problems selected were very precised to the topics and also checked the previous weeks' knowledge.</p>
<p>
I really enjoyed this project !
