# CP-SOC
<p>
<b><u>WEEK1</u></b><br>
We learnt the basics of CP in week1 that comprises sorting algorithms,time complexity anaylsis, about the different data structres like map,set,queue,stack etc.
Then it is about setting up one's respective template for coding efficiecny in contests and some problems were given as per the related topics to stregthen up the basics.

<b><u>WEEK2</u></b>
<p>
This week is more focused upon the recursive,backtracking and other efficient and popular algorithms commonly used in CP , for instance , kadane,binary search approach,two pointers approach etc.

<b><u>WEEK2</u></b>
<p>
This week is based upon DP and greedy algorithms , to learn and practise the problems associated with them.
